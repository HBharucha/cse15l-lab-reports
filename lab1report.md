## cd Commands

1. Example of using the command with no arguments.
   ![Image](cdNoPath.png)

   * The output is not an error because the terminal did not break and it works fine after

4. Example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
  ![Image](cdFile.png)
   * The working directory was the lecture1 directory

   * There is an error stating that the provided path is not a directory and this is expected because cd expects a directory as an argument to switch into that directory
